FAQ
====================
Does this work with multiplayer : Yes, though it may be pretty buggy and unoptimized

Can you add ___ : Im not working on this anymore, so most likely not

Why are their no trees/caves like in the video : The trees/caves in the video werent very good on performance and were more of a test. Also this project is more focused on the water than anything else.

Why wont the water stop flowing when I block the flow : I never could figure out how to implement this, so I gave up.
