FAQ
====================
Does this work with multiplayer : Yes, though it may be pretty buggy
Can you add ___ : Im not working on this anymore, so most likely not
Why are their no trees/caves like in the video : The trees/caves in the video werent very good on performance and were more of a test. Also this project is more focused on the water than anything else.
